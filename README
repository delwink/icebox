IceBox
======

IceBox is an inventory management application designed for use in family-owned
restaurants. Advantages over handwritten or spreadsheet inventory management
include reorder notification and waste ratio reporting.

Build
-----

The NetBeans IDE is used in developing this application, which generates `ant`
build scripts by default. You can either load the project in NetBeans yourself,
or you can build with `ant` like so:

    $ ant clean jar

The environment variable `JAVA_HOME` needs to point to a valid JDK for the
command-line build to work.

Hacking
-------

The IceBox source code uses the official code style for Java with a soft limit
on 80 columns per line in the source code. Given the verbosity of Java, some
leniency is given for particularly long lines, but try to make your code the
most readable over the must succinct.
